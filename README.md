# Rebloc (Frontend)
> A blockchain frontend in React, Redux and Typescript

Created by [@haj300](https://github.com/haj300) and [@nils-earth](https://github.com/nils-earth) in order to play around and learn about blockchain in the context of react, typescript and more.

## What it does
This frontend can communicate with the backend to mine and view blocks on the blockchain. It's very simple, play around and add more features if you like!

You'll see two buttons and a textfield:
- üíé sends a HTTP Post to the backend to mine a new block and receives the updated chain
- ‚ôªÔ∏è sends a HTTP Get to the backend to retrieve the updated chain
- Enter some values into the textfield to mine them into the next block.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
Start the frontend with `yarn start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
